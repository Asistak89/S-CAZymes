# S-CAZymes
A simple web-page to easily search carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes).
1. S-CAZy is a simple website to search CAZymes efficiently. In this study we report a simple but efficient webpage called S-CAZy for finding the classification of an CAZyme among the CAZy enzyme classes. 

2. We have classified the plant cell wall component degrading CAZymes into cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin, starch and inulin degrading CAZymes respectively.

3.S-CAZy was developed using HTML, CSS and Java script languages, search function enables users to perform a global search on the complete CAZymes list to give the information about the subjected CAZyme. 

4.S-CAZy can be used for finding all the enzymes acting on a specific substrate easily e.g. search term “Man” will result in all the enzymes involving bio-synthesis and breakdown of mannose residues respectively.

First webpage is about plant cell wall component degrading enzymes (PCW-DE): contains the list of all the CAZymes required for the breakdown of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, starch and inulin.

Second webpage is about S-CAZymes (Search carbohydrate active enzymes): this page can be used for finding the classification of a specific CAZyme of interest in the CAZy database. for e.g. search with the term “endo-beta-1,4-glucanase” will result in GH classes it is distributed GH5, GH7 and GH48.

This page can also be used for finding all the CAZymes involved in biosynthesis and breakdown of a specific substrate for e.g. Search with the first three letters "Manno","Arabino", "Fructo", "Chit", "Algi", "Chondr", "Hyalu" etc.,will result in all the CAZymes involving mannose, arabinose, fructose, chitin, alginate, hyaluronate respectively.

Third webpage is about CBMs-Enzyme Activities (Enzyme activities exhibited by carbohydrate binding modules): In this page we have listed the enzymatic activities exhibited by carbohydrate binding modules for e.g. search for the term "cellulase" and it will list all the CM classes which exhibit cellulose binding domain -1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 17, 28,  30, 32, 35, 44, 46, 49, 63, 64, 65, 72, 76, 78, 80, 81 respectively. 

Fourthe webpage is "Explore CAZymes": This page can be used for knowing and understanding the basic enzyme related information of CAZymes such as "Name, Enzyme commission number, Accepted name, Other names, Systematic name, Reaction, General comments" of a specific CAZyme of interest.
